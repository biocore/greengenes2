# Note

Following fragment placement, it was discovered that a set of eukaryotic sequences were accidentally included in the placement set. These identifiers are described in the `labels_to_remove` file. As fragment placement is independent per fragment, removal of these records after the fact does not impact other records in the tree.

To support the rooting process, we first root with an arbitrary set of bacteria, followed by rooting. The arbitrary set is in `arbitrary_bacteria.txt`
