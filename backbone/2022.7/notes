based on mock community data, we observed inconsistencies in the GTDB / LTP polyphyletic designations for the following so the polyphyletic labels were removed

open question: should we remove all species level polyphyletic labels?
- removed polyphyletic tag for s__Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- removed polyphyletic tag for s__Listeria monocytogenes
- removed polyphyletic tag for s__Bacillus cereus
