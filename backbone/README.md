# Backbone

The backbone tree is composed of the [Web of Life](https://biocore.github.io/wol/), full length 16S from the [Living Tree Project](https://imedea.uib-csic.es/mmg/ltp/), and full length 16S from [bacterial operons](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01041-y). 

The taxonomy for the backbone is comprised of the [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) as mapped through the Web of Life, and is augmented by taxonomic information from the Living Tree Project. Please see below for further details about the augmentation.

# Files

To support taxonomic decoration over all placed fragments, it is necessary to describe the taxonomy of the backbone, and identifiers to root the tree. These files are contained under versioned directories within this folder.
